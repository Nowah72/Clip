# Clip — Clipboard Manager for Windows

Clip is a modern, lightweight clipboard manager for Windows that helps you **store**, **organize**, and **reuse** anything you copy — text or images — with minimal friction.

This document serves both as a **feature overview** and a **mini user guide**.

---

## What Clip Does

Clip runs in the background and automatically keeps a history of:
- Text you copy
- Images you copy

From there, you can:
- Quickly copy items again
- Organize items into groups
- Star important items
- Drag & drop items for better organization

All with a clean, distraction-free interface.

## Main Sections (Tabs)

### Text
- Shows all copied text entries
- Click any item to copy it back to the clipboard
- No duplicate entries when re-copying existing items
- Ideal for snippets, commands, notes, or repeated text

### Images
- Shows all copied images as thumbnails
- Click an image to copy it back to the clipboard
- Images are deduplicated automatically
- Safe to re-copy without creating duplicates

### Starred
- Shows all items (text or images) you marked as starred
- Use this for frequently reused or important content
- Starred items remain accessible across sessions

### Groups
- Create custom groups to organize clipboard items
- Drag text or images into groups
- Groups help separate work contexts (e.g. Work, School, Personal)

## How to Use Clip

### Copying Items
1. Copy text or an image anywhere in Windows (Ctrl+C, right click, etc.)
2. The item instantly appears in Clip under the appropriate tab
3. No action required — it happens automatically

### Reusing Items
- **Text**: click once to copy it again
- **Image**: click once to copy it again
- The item is placed back into your clipboard, ready to paste

### Starring Items
- Click the star icon on any item
- The item will appear in the **Starred** tab
- Useful for content you use often

---

## Groups — Mini Guide

### Creating a Group
- Go to the **Groups** tab
- If no groups exist, the entire area is clickable
- Click anywhere (or the plus icon) to create a new group

### Adding Items to a Group
1. Click and drag a text or image item
2. While dragging, the app automatically switches to the Groups tab
3. Drop the item into the desired group

### Important Drag Behavior
- Clicking copies an item
- Dragging organizes an item
- These actions are clearly separated to prevent mistakes

---

## Drag & Drop Behavior (Important)

- A small mouse movement does nothing
- Once you move far enough, drag mode activates
- During drag:
  - Copy is NOT triggered
  - The UI switches to Groups automatically
- Releasing without dragging performs a normal copy

This prevents accidental actions and keeps behavior predictable.

---

## Design Philosophy

Clip is built around a few core ideas:

- **Fast** — everything is one click away
- **Predictable** — no unexpected behavior
- **Minimal** — no clutter or unnecessary UI
- **Calm** — subtle visuals that blend in

It is meant to stay out of your way and just work.

---

## Typical Use Cases

- Developers reusing code snippets
- Designers reusing images
- Students managing copied notes
- Anyone who copies the same things repeatedly

---

## Getting Started

1. Download and run the application
2. Start copying text or images as usual
3. Open Clip to browse, reuse, or organize your clipboard history

No setup required.
